# Facial Expression Recognition

### CS 4664 - Capstone Project - Facial Expression Recognition

To accomplish our goal of facial expression recognition (FER), we apply ResNet-50, a pretrained deep-CNN, on two different datasets. In addition to classifying facial expressions, we explore many different aspects of computer vision by experimenting with our final trained classifier. We also intend to create different visualizations for our model to increase insight and understanding. This git repository has the code to the various investigative experiments that we conducted, as well as our final trained classifier.

## Investigative Experiments
- Experimenting Different Model Sizes
- Experimenting Different Dataset Sizes
- Support Vector Machine Classifier vs Final Trained Classifier
- Exploring Bias in Our Model
- Adversarial Attack 
- Introducing Noise
- t-SNE Feature Visualizations
- Saliency Map using Guided Back Propagation
- Bonus: Image to Image Emotion Transfer
